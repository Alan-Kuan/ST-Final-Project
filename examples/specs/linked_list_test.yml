  - so that I can ensure the quality of my program.

scenarios:

    given: an int linked list with length {int}
    when: inserting {int} at the end of the list
    then:
      - the length of it should be {int}
      - the last element of it should be {int}
    cases:
      - given: 1
        when: 5
        then: [2, 5]
      - given: 0
        when: -1
        then: [1, -1]

    given: an int linked list with legnth {int}
    when: attempting to pop the last element of the list
