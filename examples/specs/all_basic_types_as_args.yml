  - scenario: given all supported types
    given:
      - a boolean {bool}
      - a character {char}
      - an integer {int}
      - a double {double}
      - a string {std::string}
    when: doing nothing
    then: nothing will happen
    cases:
      - given: [true, 'x', 0, 3.14, ""]
      - given: [false, 'y', 1, 1.0, "hello, world"]
